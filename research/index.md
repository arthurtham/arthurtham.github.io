# About Research
I did research with the Health and Information lab at UC Irvine under the ICS Honors Program.
My project was regarding a content analysis of diet, fitness, and Weight Self-Tracking Mobile Apps
on Google Play.

I am now taking a series of research classes at UC Irvine as a graduate student in the M.S. 
Computer Science Program.

I am also a member of Team Apps in the Mental Health in Design lab.

You can learn more about the labs that I am in by clicking on the "research" button
in the navigation bar!
