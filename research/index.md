# About Research
I did research with the Health and Information lab at UC Irvine under the ICS Honors Program.
My project was regarding a content analysis of diet, fitness, and Weight Self-Tracking Mobile Apps
on Google Play.

While mobile diet, fitness, and weight apps have become increasingly popular, 
more research is needed to assess their quality beyond ratings and reviews in app stores. 
One way to assess quality is to examine content because features can hinder adoption and 
long-term use. Research shows about half of mobile users (45.7%) stop utilizing apps due 
to hard-to-use features, and some users abandon apps because they lack desired features.

I am also a member of Team Apps in the Mental Health in Design lab.
