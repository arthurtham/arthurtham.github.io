*League of Legends* is a popular MOBA game that has been a primary focus for researchers of toxic behavior in video games. 
This paper aims to understand what adverse gameplay elements and characteristics potentially lead to such behavior.
 15 players were surveyed on their definition on adverse gameplay and their general thoughts on what proper gameplay 
 is and their reaction to adverse gameplay. These players enjoyed playing the game with their friends and attributed 
 success to teamwork, achieving objectives, and decision timing. Their definition of adverse gameplay ranges from negative
  gameplay elements to non-serious gameplay. Players may not be able to rectify adverse gameplay of others, but some are
   inclined to not blame the player for their unoptimal gameplay.
