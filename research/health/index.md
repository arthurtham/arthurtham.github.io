While mobile diet, fitness, and weight apps have become increasingly popular, 
more research is needed to assess their quality beyond ratings and reviews in app stores. 
One way to assess quality is to examine content because features can hinder adoption and 
long-term use. Research shows about half of mobile users (45.7%) stop utilizing apps due 
to hard-to-use features, and some users abandon apps because they lack desired features.
