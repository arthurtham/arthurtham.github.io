According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, as of December 2020, there are 15 million cases of COVID-19 and around 285 thousand COVID-19 related deaths in the United States. Subsequently, COVID-19 restrictions recommend people to stay indoors to help stop the spread of the virus; however, this poses new challenges for everyday tasks, such as buying food, groceries, medicine, and other essential items. There might be other reasons why people might choose to step outside their homes; however, they may not be equipped with the proper knowledge of the pandemic restrictions for the locations they want to visit.
