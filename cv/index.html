    <p>I am a software engineer and support specialist with a Master’s degree from the University of California, Irvine. I worked on various PC and web applications
         as a programmer and project manager, the resulting applications published primarily on the web. As a new graduate,
          I love learning new technologies when needed. I am currently looking for industry opportunities in software support and  engineering.

        <ul>
            <li>With the help of the American Campus Communities and UCI Summer Session, I founded and ran the Edge Basketball 
                Classic for two years. The Edge Basketball Classic was an innovative way for incoming and continuing UCI students
                 to play basketball with each other for free as (1) participants of the Freshman/Transfer Edge program, or (2)
                  residents of a UCI ACC community. It has given out awards from various sponsors such as Raising Cane's, Luna Grill,
                   and The Hill Bookstore at UCI.
                The Edge Basketball Classic also facilitated a dedicated referee/scores-keeper cohort. Participants in the cohort and
                 the players themselves eventually joined UCI Intramural Sports leagues as a result of playing in this league.

        <strong>ShoppinGo</strong><br>
        <em>A Mobile Application Prototype for Efficient Shopping</em><br>
        Mar 2021<br>
        <small>
            We developed a prototype design for an efficient shopping experience that embeds the store kiosk concept into mobile devices and optimizes the route shoppers take to purchase items. Our prototype allows users to add shopping items to a digitized shopping list and find the fastest route to gather all the items on the list. We utilized Figma to visualize our design and interviewed testers that provided their thoughts on a mobile-enhanced shopping experience that uses location services and image recognition. We found that potential users have varying shopping habits that can be enhanced by ubiquitous technology.

        <strong>Know Before You Go</strong><br>
        <em>An Application Design for COVID-19 Information</em><br>
        Dec 2020<br>
        <small>
            According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, as of December 2020, there are 15 million cases of COVID-19 and around 285 thousand COVID-19 related deaths in the United States. Subsequently, COVID-19 restrictions recommend people to stay indoors to help stop the spread of the virus; however, this poses new challenges for everyday tasks, such as buying food, groceries, medicine, and other essential items. There might be other reasons why people might choose to step outside their homes; however, they may not be equipped with the proper knowledge of the pandemic restrictions for the locations they want to visit.
            We decided to learn about what information people want to know before going outside during the pandemic and then created an application prototype tailored to those needs that can help people know all the information they want before they go somewhere.

        <strong>Adverse Gameplay in League of Legends</strong><br>
        <em>A Preliminary Analysis of Player Perspectives on Teammate Gameplay in a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Game.</em><br>
        Mar 2020<br>
        <small>
            League of Legends is a popular MOBA game that has been a primary focus for researchers of toxic behavior in video games. This paper aims to understand what adverse gameplay elements and characteristics potentially lead to such behavior. 15 players were surveyed on their definition on adverse gameplay and their general thoughts on what proper gameplay is and their reaction to adverse gameplay. These players enjoyed playing the game with their friends and attributed success to teamwork, achieving objectives, and decision timing. Their definition of adverse gameplay ranges from negative gameplay elements to non-serious gameplay. Players may not be able to rectify adverse gameplay of others, but some are inclined to not blame the player for their unoptimal gameplay.        </small>

        <strong>Self-Tracking Mobile Apps</strong><br>
        <em>A Content Analysis of Popular Diet, Fitness, and Weight Self-Tracking Mobile Apps on Google Play.</em><br>
        May 2019<br>
        Advisor: Dr. Elizabeth Eikey<br>
        <small>
            While mobile diet, fitness, and weight apps have become increasingly popular, more research is needed to assess their quality beyond ratings and reviews in app stores. One way to assess quality is to examine content because features can hinder adoption and long-term use. Research shows about half of mobile users (45.7%) stop utilizing apps due to hard-to-use features, and some users abandon apps because they lack desired features.
