"Who Wants to be a Millionaire" is a take on the popular trivia game show of the same name. First created in GameMaker: Studio in 2016, it featured the classic three lifelines and a custom set of questions. It was one of the first GameMaker games I ever made for a target, public group of people in a collegiate club.

For this version 1.2h release, in 2020, I updated its visuals and generalized it so that enthusiasts of the game show can enjoy my first published game. It has mostly the same features as the 2016 version except the questions are from the 2020 US Primetime revival of the show.

The rules of the game are simple: answer 15 questions and you will win 1 Million Virtual Dollars. The more questions you get right, the more virtual money you will win. You have three lifelines to help you, so use them wisely.

Enjoy!
