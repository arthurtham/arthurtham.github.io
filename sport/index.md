            I have always been a fan of sports, both playing and spectating! 
            I had been playing basketball since I was 12 years old.
            My favorite teams are the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Angels,
            San Francisco Giants, Texas Rangers, and the UCI Anteaters.
            My current rotation of sports include basketball and baseball/softball.
            I currently play in UCI's Intramural Sports leagues.

# Turtle Trotters

![alt text](/img/sportsIMTurtle.jpg "Turtle")

The Turtle Trotters are special group of people that I was fortunate enough to coach.
They all go by the philosophy that "whatever their mind can conceive, their heart believe,
they will then achieve." (CBA) They also learn first and foremost to have confidence
in their skills before they step out on the court. By shaking hands with the referee,
helping each other up, and expressing joy over the stress of winning, these players
show what it is like to be leaders in service to their personal health. 

# Sports Coordinator

I was fortunate enough to be the Intramural Sports Coordinator for my service club, 
UCI Circle K. With the philosophy I put on my Turtles, I encourage members to go try new sports
while embodying the three tenets: service, leadership, and fellowship. My cohort of captains
and I have won three championships together, and it's all thanks to them that they make
Circle K's involvement in Intramural Sports so great.

# Edge Basketball Classic

With the help of the American Campus Communities and UCI Summer Session, I founded
and ran the Edge Basketball Classic for two years. The Edge Basketball Classic was
an innovative way for incoming and continuing UCI students to play basketball with
each other for free as (1) participants of the Freshman/Transfer Edge program, or 
(2) residents of a UCI ACC community. It has given out awards from various sponsors
such as Raising Cane's, Luna Grill, and The Hill Bookstore at UCI.

The Edge Basketball Classic also facilitated a dedicated referee/scores-keeper cohort.
Participants in the cohort and the players themselves eventually joined UCI 
 Intramural Sports leagues as a result of playing in this league.

# Referee
![alt text](/img/sportsRef.jpg "Referee")

I first started refereeing games in football and basketball during my senior year of 
high school for its intramural leagues. Since then, I had refereed all the games in the inaugural Edge
Basketball Classic games in 2017 and a subset of games in the second iteration in 2018, 
before joining UCI Campus Recreation as an official referee in 2019. In this position I am blessed
to be able to referee games for a variety of clubs, from Tomo no Kai to Chinese Association.
I'm slated to continue my role in this capacity in 2020.

I have refereed over 50 basketball and softball games in my current role as referee/umpire 
at UCI Campus Recreation.
