# About Sports
I have always been a fan of sports, both playing and spectating! 
My current rotation of sports include basketball and baseball/softball.
I currently play in UCI's Intramural Sports leagues.

# Turtle Trotters

The Turtle Trotters are special group of people that I was fortunate enough to coach.
They all go by the philosophy that "whatever their mind can conceive, their heart believe,
they will then achieve." (CBA) They also learn first and foremost to have confidence
in their skills before they step out on the court. By shaking hands with the referee,
helping each other up, and expressing joy over the stress of winning, these players
show what it is like to be leaders in service to their personal health. 

# Sports Coordinator

I was also fortunate enough to be the Intramural Sports Coordinator for my service club, 
UCI Circle K. With the philosophy I put on my Turtles, I encourage members to go try new sports
while embodying the three tenets: service, leadership, and fellowship. My cohort of captains
and I have won three championships together, and it's all thanks to them that they make
Circle K's involvement in Intramural Sports so great.
