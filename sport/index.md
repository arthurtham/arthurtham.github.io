            <p>I have always been a fan of sports, both playing and spectating! 
            I had been playing basketball since I was 12 years old.
            My favorite teams are the Golden State Warriors, San Francisco Giants, 
            and the UCI Anteaters.
            My rotation of sports before COVID-19 include basketball and baseball/softball.
            I last played in and worked for the UCI Intramural Sports leagues.</p>
            <p>I am currently interested in shoutcasting for various eSport events.
            I used to commentate VALORANT charity games, and nowadays I commentate Tetris
                seasonally, also for charity. I now also freelance as a broadcast producer, since 2022.</p>

                    <p>The Turtle Trotters are special group of people that I was fortunate enough to coach.
                    They all go by the philosophy that "whatever their mind can conceive, their heart believe,
                    they will then achieve." (CBA) They also learn first and foremost to have confidence
                    in their skills before they step out on the court. By shaking hands with the referee,
                    helping each other up, and expressing joy over the stress of winning, these players
                    show what it is like to be leaders in service to their personal health.</p>

                    <p>I was fortunate enough to be the Intramural Sports Coordinator for my service club, 
                    UCI Circle K. With the philosophy I put on my Turtles, I encourage members to go try new sports
                    while embodying the three tenets: service, leadership, and fellowship. My cohort of captains
                    and I have won three championships together, and it's all thanks to them that they make
                    Circle K's involvement in Intramural Sports so great.</p>

                    <p>With the help of the American Campus Communities and UCI Summer Session, I founded
                    and ran the Edge Basketball Classic for two years. The Edge Basketball Classic was
                    an innovative way for incoming and continuing UCI students to play basketball with
                    each other for free as (1) participants of the Freshman/Transfer Edge program, or 
                    (2) residents of a UCI ACC community. It has given out awards from various sponsors
                    such as Raising Cane's, Luna Grill, and The Hill Bookstore at UCI.</p>
                    <p>The Edge Basketball Classic also facilitated a dedicated referee/scores-keeper cohort.
                    Participants in the cohort and the players themselves eventually joined UCI 
                    Intramural Sports leagues as a result of playing in this league.</p>

                    I enrolled in a UCI shoutcasting course hosted by UCI eSports to learn more about the fundamentals
                    of shoutcasting. Since that class, I shoutcasted multiple VALORANT tournaments in the collegiate and streamer space. I also host my own VALORANT events, where I am the broadcast producer: <a href="https://arttham.com/redirect/valoranttournament" target="_blank">Event Link</a>.

                    <p>I first started refereeing games in football and basketball during my senior year of 
                    high school for its intramural leagues. Since then, I had refereed all the games in the inaugural Edge
                    Basketball Classic games in 2017 and a subset of games in the second iteration in 2018, 
                    before joining UCI Campus Recreation as an official referee in 2019. In this position I am blessed
                    to be able to referee games for a variety of clubs, from Tomo no Kai to Chinese Association.
                    I'm slated to continue my role in this capacity in 2020.</p>
                    <p>I have refereed over 50 basketball and softball games in my current role as referee/umpire 
                    at UCI Campus Recreation.</p>
