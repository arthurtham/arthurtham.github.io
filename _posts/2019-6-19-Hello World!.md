Welcome to my blog!

There's nothing to see here, but I hope I get to write
about more things as the days go by.

Here's a little bit about myself. My name is Arthur and I'm a 1st year M.S. Computer
Science graduate student at UC Irvine. I do a lot of things. I play sports, make games
and videos, and do community service.

Above all, I am an Anteater for life! ...as in I have been an Anteater since I
started my undergraduate career. I'm hoping that I write more about the things
that I do on this blog.

Thanks for stopping by!
